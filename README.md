# Retail Ecommerce BackEnd

## Retail Ecommerce BackEnd
To finish my Retail Ecommerce BackEnd, I had to create the API routes for the categories, products, and tags. I also had to create the models for the categories, products, and tags. Using Insomnia, I was able to show that the routes and models that I updated worked to not only show the specific products, categories, and tags within the ecommerce site, but also, show that the user will be able to create new items, update items, and delete items from the site.
